                Hi there! My name is Adam Kaufman. I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree from Rochester Institute of Technology. While there I majored in Game Design & Development, with minors in Archaeology and Political Science. At heart, I'm a programmer, a designer, and a researcher, with interests ranging from general software development, to making games, to advanced computer science theory, to web development, to history and politics (varied, I know). But basically (and why you're probably here), I really enjoy typing code into a computer and making interesting things appear on the screen. Based on that, my interests include things like developing software and websites, both designing and developing games, and experimenting with new technologies. While I primarily consider myself a front end developer when it comes to application software, my interests and capabilities are extremely varied. I have plenty of experience working on all aspects of an application and getting a project off the ground from conception to production. I also often play around with a variety of advanced topics and areas in computer science such as artificial intelligence, game theory, neural networks, and plenty more!
                <br /><br />
                Right now, I am working for GEICO, where I've been for the past year since graduation. While I enjoy my work and the impact I've been able to have there, life circumstances have me looking for a new opportunity back in my home state of New York.
                <br /><br />
                Outside of work, my current side project (other than setting up this portfolio and looking for a new job), has been playing around with the development toolkit for the Amazon Echo. Voice assistants are a very fun application of natural language processing and speech recognition, and while it's hard to say what the future of this technology will be, I've definitely enjoyed experimenting with the toolkit (even if I haven't made any actual showcase-worthy projects yet).
